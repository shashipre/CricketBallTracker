The main idea of the project is to give feedback system to machine and player so he can know how well he is playing each move, my project is not that advance but i tried my level best.
I used computer Vision to track the ball and kalman filter to detect whether the ball is hitting the bat or not, using change in trajectory

the main code is in finaloutput and kalman filter code files, the model is trained using balltracking code ihaven't uploaded the videos that we used for training and testing so i think code may not work until use provided the video footage and also i used red ball, if ball type is different from the ball i used for trainig it may not work, you can train with your own footage by using roboflow dataset creation process,i provided weights which can be used if you are using same king of ball inside the video
